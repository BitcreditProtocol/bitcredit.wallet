            IMPORTANT NOTICE: THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE A MEDIATION-FIRST
            CLAUSE REQUIRING MEDIATION BEFORE ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION. PLEASE
            READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE

          <strong>
            ALL REFERENCES TO LAW, REGULATION, AND JURISDICTION IN THESE TERMS
            REFER TO THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE USER’S JURISDICTION. USERS
            ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE LEGALITY AND REGULATORY
            COMPLIANCE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) constitute the entire agreement
          and understanding between you (“you” or “your”) and Cashu.me
          (“Cashu.me,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Cashu.me
          website and any related applications, software, code, or services
          (collectively, the “Site” or “Services”). By accessing or using the
          Site or Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and
          agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not access
          or use the Site or Services.
        </p>
        <p><strong>1. Nature of the Services</strong></p>
        <p>
          1.1 <strong>Non-Custodial Web Application:</strong> Cashu.me provides
          a non-custodial web application (“wallet”) that is executed entirely
          on your device. Our Site merely makes available client-side code
          implementing the open-source Cashu protocol. We do not run a server
          that holds your ecash or executes transactions on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 <strong>No Control Over Mints:</strong> Cashu.me does not issue
          ecash and does not operate or control any Mint. The choice of any Mint
          and any transaction or relationship you establish with that Mint is
          solely between you and that Mint. Cashu.me has no involvement,
          responsibility, or liability in any such interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 <strong>No Funds Access:</strong> At no time does Cashu.me have
          custody, possession, or control of your ecash. Transactions occur
          solely by your actions and through your chosen Mint. We do not
          monitor, verify, or facilitate transfers between you and any Mint or
          other parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.4 <strong>Web Server Only:</strong> Cashu.me does not operate any
          servers except for the web server that delivers the application to
          your device. The application is executed entirely on your device.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. User Responsibilities & Disclaimers</strong></p>
        <p>
          2.1 <strong>User’s Sole Responsibility:</strong> You understand and
          agree that you use the Site and Services at your own risk and for your
          own account. You alone are fully responsible for selecting Mints,
          conducting transactions, and safeguarding your ecash and secret
          values. Cashu.me is not a party to and disclaims any responsibility
          for any agreements, terms, or disputes between you and any Mint.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 <strong>No Partnership with Mints:</strong> Cashu.me is not
          affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any Mint. We make no
          representations, warranties, or guarantees about any Mint’s integrity,
          legality, liquidity, or functionality. Your relationship with any
          Mint, including the issuance, redemption, or valuation of ecash, is
          solely a matter between you and that Mint.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 <strong>Risk of Ecash:</strong> Ecash is an experimental,
          bearer-like digital asset that may not be recognized as money,
          currency, or a store of value. Anyone with the secret value has
          control over the ecash. You agree to review and understand all risks
          disclosed in our Risk Disclosure Statement before using ecash.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Modifications to Terms</strong></p>
        <p>
          We may amend or update these Terms at any time without notice. Your
          continued use of the Site or Services after any modifications
          constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree,
          discontinue your use.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Compliance with Laws</strong></p>
        <p>
          Your use of the Site and any Services is void where prohibited by law.
          You must determine whether your use of ecash and related activities
          are lawful. You are solely responsible for compliance with all
          applicable laws, taxes, and regulations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>5. License to Use the Site</strong></p>
        <p>
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited,
          personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use
          the Site. We may suspend or terminate your access at our sole
          discretion.

        <p><strong>7. Indemnification and Release</strong></p>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Cashu.me and its affiliates
          from claims arising out of your use of the Site or Services. If you
          have a dispute with any Mint or third party, you release Cashu.me from
          all related claims.

        <p><strong>8. Mediation and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
        <p>
          8.1 <strong>Mediation Requirement:</strong> If a dispute arises out of
          or relates to these Terms, the Site, or the Services, the parties
          agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute through good-faith
          mediation administered by a reputable mediation provider. Each party
          shall bear its own costs for the mediation, and the costs of the
          mediator shall be shared equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 <strong>Arbitration Option:</strong> If mediation does not resolve
          the dispute within 30 days (or a mutually agreed period), either party
          may initiate final and binding arbitration administered by a reputable
          arbitration provider. Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual

        </p>
        <p>
          8.3 <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial:</strong> If arbitration is not
          invoked and the dispute proceeds to court, you waive your right to a
          trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by law.
        </p>
        <p><strong>9. Prohibited Uses</strong></p>
